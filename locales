Webview were not installed. The script solved the problem, but you will need to run it again.
SEPARATOR
Sorry, the environment is externally managed so cannot install webview. On Ubuntu/Debian, try sudo apt install python3-webview or sudo apt install python-webview.

Options:
-h, --help: display this message;
-o, --online: suppose that the user is online and will not try to access local pages.
-u --update: update the program;
-p --private: open in private mode.

Currently only one argument can be used once (you cannot combine them). So baggins -o and baggins -p is valid, but baggins -p -o or baggins -po is not.
SEPARATOR
I am currently working on the update function. I am NOT responsible for any problem/data loss that occur.
SEPARATOR
The update has been completed. To upgrade the other files as well, pass -U or --full-upgrade.
